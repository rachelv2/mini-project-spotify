# LyricaLytics: A Data Analytics Project Using Spotify's Database

This project analyzes music streaming data to uncover patterns in **listener behavior, song characteristics, and genre popularity**. Using Spotify chart data from **2014–2022**, the goal is to understand how factors such as **song duration, explicit lyrics, and regional genre preferences** influence streaming performance.

The analysis combines **data cleaning, database design, exploratory analysis, and visualization** to generate insights that can support **artists, producers, and streaming platforms in making data-driven decisions**.

# Methodology

### 1. Data Acquisition

The dataset was sourced from **Spotify chart data (2014–2022)** containing information about tracks, artists, genres, and streaming performance. 

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Key preprocessing steps included:

* Handling missing values
* Standardizing genre labels
* Mapping country codes to country names
* Organizing the dataset into structured tables

### 3. Database Design

The project uses a relational structure connecting:

* Tracks
* Artists
* Genres
* Charts
* Countries

An **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** was used to visualize these relationships. 

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

Key variables explored:

* Track duration
* Explicit lyrics
* Genre categories
* Regional listening patterns

---

# Results and Insights

## Engagement Curve: Song Duration

Analysis shows that song duration follows an **engagement curve**.

Listeners typically prefer songs that are:

* Long enough to feel complete
* Short enough to maintain attention

Songs that are too short may feel unfinished, while very long songs may lead to listener drop-off. 

**Key Insight**

Songs around **3–4 minutes** tend to generate the strongest engagement.

---

## Explicit Lyrics and Streaming Performance

The share of explicit songs increased significantly from **about 5% in 2014 to roughly 27% in 2022**. 

Between **2016 and 2021**, explicit songs consistently achieved **higher average streams** than non-explicit songs.

However, by **2022**, non-explicit songs began outperforming explicit songs, suggesting a possible shift in listener behavior.

---

## Regional Genre Preferences

Genre popularity varies across different regions. While genres such as **Pop and Hip-Hop** perform strongly worldwide, other genres appear more concentrated in specific markets.

This suggests that **regional culture and listening habits influence music consumption**.

# Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

* Target **3–4 minute song lengths** for commercial releases to maximize listener engagement.
* Consider **shortened or radio edits** for songs longer than 5 minutes.
* Use **short tracks primarily for social media promotion**, rather than primary streaming releases.
* Maintain a **balanced mix of explicit and non-explicit songs** to reach broader audiences.
* Release **both explicit and clean versions** of songs to increase playlist and distribution opportunities.
